BirdVoxDetect is a pre-trained deep learning system which detects flight calls from songbirds in audio recordings, and retrieves the corresponding species.
It relies on per-channel energy normalization (PCEN) and context-adaptive convolutional neural networks (CA-CNN) for improved robustness to background noise.
It is made available both as a Python library and as a command-line tool for Windows, OS X, and GNU/Linux.


## Installation

The simplest way to install BirdVoxDetect is by using the ``pip`` package management system, which will also install the additional required dependencies
if needed.

    pip install birdvoxdetect

 Note that birdvoxdetect requires:
* Python (3.6, 3.7, or 3.8)
* librosa (==0.7.0)
* tensorflow (>=2)
* scikit-learn (==0.21.2)
* birdvoxclassify (0.2)
* h5py
* pandas


## Usage

### From the command line

To analyze one file:

    birdvoxdetect path/to/file.wav

To analyze multiple files:

    birdvoxdetect path/to/file1.wav path/to/file2.wav

To analyze one folder:

    birdvoxdetect path/to/folder

On Windows:

    birdxodetect path\to\folder

Optional arguments:

    --clip-duration CLIP_DURATION, -d CLIP_DURATION
                          Duration of the exported clips, expressed in seconds
                          (fps). The default value is 1.0, that is, one second.
                          We recommend values of 0.5 or above.
    --export-clips, -c    Export detected events as audio clips in WAV format.
    --export-confidence, -C
                          Export the time series of model confidence values of
                          events in HDF5 format.
    --export-faults, -f   Export list of sensor faults in CSV format.
    --export-logger, -l   Export output of Python logger in TXT format.
    --output-dir OUTPUT_DIR, -o OUTPUT_DIR
                          Directory to save the output file(s); The default
                          value is the same directory as the input file(s).
    --predict-proba, -p   Export output probabilities in JSON format.
    --quiet, -q           Print less messages on screen.
    --suffix SUFFIX, -s SUFFIX
                          String to append to the output filenames.The default
                          value is the empty string.
    --threshold THRESHOLD, -t THRESHOLD
                          Detection threshold, between 10 and 90. The default
                          value is 50. Greater values lead to higher precision
                          at the expense of a lower recall.
    --verbose, -v         Print timestamps of detected events.
    --version, -V         Print version number.


### From Python

Call syntax:

    import birdvoxdetect as bvd    
    df = bvd.process_file('path/to/file.wav')

`df` is a Pandas DataFrame with three columns: time, detection confidence, and species.

Below is a typical output from the test suite (file path `tests/data/audio/fd79e55d-d3a3-4083-aba1-4f00b545c3d6.wav`):

    Time (hh:mm:ss)	Detection confidence (%)	Order	Order confidence (%)	Family	Family confidence (%)	Species (4-letter code)	Species confidence (%)
    00:00:08.78	70.14839	Passeriforme	92.61552095413210	Turdidae	98.76762628555300	SWTH	99.93199110031130
